# splitmate_flutter

The Flutter part of the SplitMate app. I will record the weekly development progress in this file.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


## Weekly Progress

### Week 04
1. The overall development route is clarified, and the entire project uses the GetX library as a state management tool;
2. Rethink the project architecture(not determined, still need to talk with other group members in the weekly meeting);
3. Implement three pages: Login page, apply page and splash screen.
